  <p>
    I want to tell you a story.
Once upon a time there were three roomates studying day before the exam. They are preparing for tommorrow exam. They always fond of reading day before the exam. They got some important question from their faculty but mostly it is not required because it covered the whole syllabus. They studied 4 units before the big day of exam and confident about writing something related in the exam but the problem is they left main 5 unit which was not read for any of the exam. They thaught 4 units enough for today we will read the 5 unit for tommorrow morning on the day of exam and they slept. 
The next day
The student who slept in the middle of the two other student woke up and turned right to him and saw that one sleeping on the write woke up and he was reading then he turned left the other one also woke up and practicing. He felt bad and went for restroom and came back then he asked guys what are you reading then the boy on the right who was writing said he was revising the whole he learnt yesterday and the boy on the left said he is writing the 5 unit. Remaining two got shock and asked the third person we all decide to read 5 unit know but you ignored us and reading separately and they both are angry on the third one. Then the third person said guys be cool I said I am writing not practicing. I am writing this to do malpractice in the exam. The remaining two were shocked.

Story continues.....
